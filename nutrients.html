                      AgroLED® has many advantages over traditional light
                      sources including lower energy consumption, longer
                      lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size and
                      faster switching. Ideal for all phases of plant growth!
                      AgroLED® grow light models can be customized to emit only
                      specific wavelengths of light for plant growth and

                      important factor for photosynthesis, flowering and
                      fruiting. This red spectrum promotes plant growth,
                      flowering and fruit fulfillment. Blue spectrum light
