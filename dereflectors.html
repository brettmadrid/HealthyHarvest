                      The patented sealed optic technology allows removal of
                      heat generated by the lamp without cooling the lamp. Made
                      specifically for double-ended horticulture lamps (not
                      included). Features German made, UL listed double-ended
                      sockets. Unique double-ended construction allows for
                      maximum optical efficiency and uniformity. Improved
                      spectrum DE lamps used in this fixture focus on the red
                      component for increased photosynthetic response. They
                      offer improved PAR values and increased PAR/lumen
                      maintenance (up to 90% PAR at 10,000 hours of operation).
                      The AC/DE’s patent pending design allows removal of heat
                      generated by the lamp without cooling the lamp below
                      proper operating temperature. 95% reflective textured
                      German aluminum interior with 98% reflective corner
                      inserts offer excellent uniformity, output and diffusion.
                      Galvanized steel housing with durable powder coated
                      finish. Manufactured with exacting standards. It features
                      double gaskets (between glass & reflector and glass &
                      frame) for an air tight seal. Hinged glass makes changing
                      lamps and cleaning glass easy. 15 ft detachable lamp cord.
                      Comes with built in level for easy, consistent, level
                      hanging.

                      The Sun System® ProCom™ 110° Wide Throw Commercial DE
                      Remote Reflector is designed in the USA. Excellent wide
                      throw 110° uniform light pattern is ideal for both
                      crossover, supplemental and primary lighting applications.
                      The small footprint reduces shadowing in open
                      greenhouse/supplemental lighting applications. 95%
