                      Doktor Doom® Spider Mite Knock Out® is a .20% pyrethrin
                      formula. This formula is 19 times stronger in active

                      Mite Knock Out® kills the pests on contact with just a
                      light misting on the foliage. Apply the Doktor Doom®
                      Spider Mite Knock Out® to the underside of the leaves and
                      then fog the room with a Doktor Doom® Fogger. The smell of

                      Tree Tanglefoot Pest Barrier is effective against crawling
                      insects who must reach the tops of trees in order to feed,
                      mate, or deposit eggs. Such insects include cankerworms,
                      gypsy moth caterpillars, army and tent caterpillars, ants,
                      obscure root weevils and pecan weevils, tussock moths and
                      climbing cutworms. Tree Tanglefoot Pest Barrier provides
                      the perfect solution to protecting your valuable trees and
                      reducing future populations of these pests. As the insects
                      climb up over the sticky material, they become trapped
                      without escape.

                      Don’t Bug Me® is a fast, effective solution for most
                      common garden pests. Because its active ingredient is
                      Pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemum flowers, it
                      can be applied up to the day of harvest on any fruit or
                      vegetable. Don’t Bug Me® kills aphids, whitefly, and other
                      insects on contact by damaging their nervous systems, and
                      even at lower levels it will keep pests away.

                      provides a barrier for plants to protect them against
                      damaging insects.
                    </p>
                    <p>How it Works:</p>
                    <p>
                      Spider mites, White flies, Nematodes, Scales and other
                      insects destroy plant cells by sucking out their fluids or
                      chewing up the cell walls. SNS-209™’s unique formula works
                      by allowing the plant to uptake a small amount of
                      rosemeric acid from the rosemary plant. As the plant
                      distributes the rosemeric acid throughout its cell walls,
                      a barrier is soon constructed. When an insect starts to
                      suck or chew on the plant, it comes in contact with the
                      rosemeric acid and causes the insect to stop eating, move
                      on or die.

                    </p>
                    <p>How it Works:</p>
                    <p>
                      SNS-217™’s unique formula works by providing a barrier
                      which is harmless to the plant, but fatal to the mites.
                      The natural salts and fatty acids derived from Rosemary
                      extracts disrupt the insect cell structure and increase
                      the permeability of its membranes. Cell contents then leak
                      from damaged cells and the spider mites quickly dehydrate
                      and die. SNS-217™ Spider Mite Control kills the spider
                      mite eggs by coating the eggs with an oily shield that
                      disrupts the respiration to the egg; therefore no hatching
                      will occur, they will just dry out.

                    <p>How it Works:</p>
                    <p>
                      Airborne ‘pathogenic’ or disease causing fungi get inside
                      the plant either by contacting its skin (epidermis), or by
                      growing in through the plant’s breathing holes (stomata).
                      Then they either poison and kill the plant cells before
                      absorbing food from them or simply steal nutrients from
                      the living cells. Some fungi live in the soil and enter
                      into the roots. They can either block the water-conducting
                      cells or kill them, causing the plant to wilt. In many
                      cases the plant is seriously damaged or may even die. As a
                      topical spray SNS-244™ Natural Fungicide kills the fungus
                      through a biochemical interaction on the spores.
