                        <h4>Sun System® Par Pro®</h4>
                        <p> Commercial Reflector is optically engineered for the high performance Par Pro® 1100 watt Hyper Arc® High Pressure Sodium lamp. Fabricated, assembled, and designed in the USA. Open reflector design allows light to get closer to the plant canopy. Vented side louvers allow for heat dissipation of the lamp while still maintaining optimal operating temperature. Uniform light pattern is ideal for both crossover, supplemental and primary lighting applications. The small footprint reduces shadowing in open greenhouse/supplemental lighting applications. Designed specifically for the Par Pro® 1100 watt Hyper Arc® High Pressure Sodium lamp (lamp included) to provide optimal efficiency and uniformity in your commercial environment. The Hyper Arc® lamp delivers a staggering 2,380 µmol on the Sun System® 1 DE 1000 watt turbo setting!

                        <h4>Parazontal Reflector</h4>
                        <p> The Sunleaves Parazontal Reflector is the answer for gardeners seeking even light distribution in their growing spaces. With an extra-wide 39" span, the Parazontal Reflector can cover small- to medium-sized areas thoroughly. It features a high-quality European (German Alanod) aluminum center insert reflector and the ability to position the lamp vertically or horizontally, depending on the gardener's needs. The 2000W, 600V pulse-rated Leviton socket is compatible with both metal halide and high pressure sodium bulbs, and comes with a 15' cord with integrated ballast plug. Hanging hardware is also included, and the Reflector is easy to assemble using its detailed step-by-step instructions.</p>

                        <h4>Silver Sun Reflector</h4>
                        <p> Similar to the Vertizontal, the Silver Sun combines the features of the traditional vertical and horizontal reflectors into one exceptional reflector. Made from 95% reflective German aluminum. Large size provides for a large coverage area even when placed close to plants. V-strike bend above lamp to increase performance. Pre-wired with lamp cord and socket.</p>

                        <h4>Vertizontal Reflector - Provides Advantages of Both Vertical and Horizontal</h4>
                        <h5>Advantages of Vertical Reflectors</h5>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Large size provides a wide area of coverage from low mounting heights.</li>
                          <li>Will accommodate all sizes of MH and HPS lamps.</li>
                          <li>Low mounting height reduces distance to plants and thus increases light levels.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Advantages of Horizontal Reflectors</h5>
                        <p>HID lamps emit light in a continuous 360° ring emanating out from the arc tube. The main reason horizontally mounted lamps perform better is because much of their light is thrown downward.</p>

                            <li>Heavy duty galvanized steel mounting bracket.</li>
                            <li>Corners are rounded – no sharp corners unlike competitive “gull-wing” type reflectors.</li>

                            <h4>Super Light Spreaders</h4>
                            <p> How & Why They Work! The design of the Super Spreader® is based on logic and simplicity. All horizontal reflectors create an over hot, over bright spot directly beneath the lamp. The Super-Spreader® spreads the excess light and heat proportionally to all areas of the grow room (especially the corners and edges which are often underlit). This creates even light and more harmonious growing conditions throughout the entire grow room.  NOTE: By attaching the Super-Spreader® accessory, the Adjust-A-Wings® performance may be enhanced significantly.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Adjust-A-Wings® fitted with Super-Spreader® can be lowered to an unprecedented 10"-12" from growing plants to produce awesome growing power while maintaining maximum area coverage and minimum heat build-up. Yield increases of up to 50% are not uncommon with proper use of this truly outstanding product.</p>
